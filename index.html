			<h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>The topic</h3>
			<p>Design a web page for the "BRIGHTER FUTURE CAT RESCUE" charity organization, which can support and promote their cause online. The website will focus on functions such as volunteer service, donation, merchandise and pet adoption. This page will introduce my background research, design concept and iterative process.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>I will use two research methods-data analysis and online questionnaires.</p>
       <p>The main goal of data analysis is to analyze the financial information of the "BRIGHTER FUTURE CAT RESCUE" organization, and determine which parts of the organization should focus on in the future by analyzing the income and expenditure trends of the organization.</p> 
      <p>The main goal of the online questionnaire is to determine my design direction by answering questions, such as color, format, main structure and what part I should focus on.</p>

      <h4 id="Data">Data analysis</h4>
            <p>In this data analysis, I focused on comparing the revenue in 2019 and 2020, looking for the advantages and disadvantages of the "BRIGHTER FUTURE CAT RESCUE" organization during the development period, in order to avoid the disadvantages and increase the advantages in the future.</p>
            			<figure>
				<img src="Research/Data.jpg" alt="Data"/>
      </figure>
            <p>According to the pie chart, from 2019 to 2020, the total income of the "BRIGHTER FUTURE CAT RESCUE" organization has increased from $93,602.00 to $122,708.00. Among them, the income from Donations And Bequests increased from $53,055.00 to $63,287.00. As one of the main incomes of charity websites, this increase is beneficial. However, the income from Goods or Services has dropped from $40,547.00 to $17,511.00, which shows that the organization lacks publicity in this area. Therefore, web design needs to focus on this aspect. At the same time, the Donations And Bequests aspect also needs to be paid attention to, because it is one of the most important sources of income.</p>

      <h4 id="Online">Online questionnaires</h4>

      <p>In this questionnaire, I focus on researching users’ concerns on charity websites and their views on different websites, in order to better support and promote the cause of the "BRIGHTER FUTURE CAT RESCUE" organization. 30 people answered my questionnaire.Forms response chart. Question title: Do you like to browse charity websites about animals?. Number of responses: 30 responses.</p>
            			<figure>
				<img src="Research/question.jpg" alt="Question"/>
      </figure>
            <p>According to the survey, more than 80% of people like to browse charity websites about animals, and 80% of people watch the websites on average or above. Therefore, most people pay attention to charity websites.</p>
            			<figure>
				<img src="Research/Q1.jpg" alt="Question"/>
      </figure>
                  <p>According to the survey, 20 people are interested in volunteer activities and donations, 18 people are interested in animal adoption, and 15 people are interested in merchandise sales. More than 50% of people are interested in these four aspects, so web design should focus on these four aspects.</p>
            			<figure>
				<img src="Research/Q2.jpg" alt="Question"/>
      </figure>
            <p>According to the survey, more than 50% of the people who choose Yes in the three aspects of donations, volunteer activities and animal adoption. So the page design in these three aspects should be more attractive.</p>
            			<figure>
				<img src="Research/Q3.jpg" alt="Question"/>
      </figure>
            <p>According to the survey, I found that 56.7% of users think that websites need to be easy to read and find things easily. 60% of users believe that web design requires four to six colors. I will ensure that my website layout achieves this goal.</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>A mood board is a digital collage or set of elements that can help define the direction of a website. It should not be confused with the physical model. A mood board can be thought of as a high-level creative summary, but you can include actual visual and UI elements instead of a written description of the site’s visual and UI elements.</p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      <h4 id="colour">Colour</h4>
			<p>Before web design, I want to determine my color. I am going to choose blue as the main color, because blue represents trust and reliability in psychology. I think trust and reliability are important for a charity website that rescues animals. I made three different palettes based on color combinations.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/colour.jpg" alt="colour"/>
      </figure>
			<p>By comparison, I decided to use Complementary palette. Because in the charity website needs some options that are highlighted, such as donation options. Having a contrasting color can easily highlight these options. At the same time, orange represents vitality, similar to the vitality of a cat.</p>
     	<p>How to use these colors:</p>
        			<ul>
				<li>White: Can be used as a background/background color.</li>
				<li>Black: can be used for text.</li>
				<li>Blue: Choose a color that is very different from the text color but has good contrast with the main background color. In this case, the color will be light blue. This color is very suitable for hyperlinks.</li>
        				<li>Light Blue: This is the main color, so it may set the tone for the design. It may be used for certain backgrounds, buttons, graphics.</li>
				<li>Orange: This is an accent color. It can be designed to add color. Can be used for some buttons, others, icons and graphics.</li>
			</ul>
      <h4 id="Font">Fonts</h4>
      			<p>In the choice of fonts, I mainly use two fonts Times New Roman and Kristen ITC. Times New Roman is used for most of the text. This font is usually used for writing essays and can express the text more clearly. Kristen ITC is used for specific text, such as the name "Brighter Future Cat Rescue" and the name of a cat. This font is as cute as a cat and can give a deep impression.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/font.jpg" alt="font"/>
      </figure>
       <h4 id="final">The final mood board</h4>
             			<p>In the end, I chose to integrate the color, font and other factors together, and then add related pictures. For Brighter Future Cat Rescue, these pictures will be about cats. This is the final mood board.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/final.jpg" alt="final"/>
      </figure>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
      <h4 id="1">Homepage</h4>
      <p>First of all, I designed a long navigation bar, the free space is used to put information. But I think the long navigation bar is not very useful, so in the second concept I chose to make a small navigation bar on the left, which can put more information on the web page. But for a charity website about pets, it doesn’t require much navigation, so I finally chose to put the navigation bar on top. When users open the webpage, they will first see a big picture of an animal, which has a strong visual impact. </p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/s1.jpg" alt="home"/>
      </figure>
      <h4 id="2">Introduction page</h4>
            <p>For the introduction, the entire page needs to be simple and clear, introducing the organization's overview and member information.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/s2.jpg" alt="intro"/>
      </figure>
      <h4 id="3">Adopt page</h4>
            <p>For the adoption part, my first concept is that users can see search options and photos of cats after opening the webpage, and users can click on the photos to select or search for them. However, I don't think this kind of information is enough for users, so in my second concept, I chose to add a paragraph of text and pictures to introduce the rules of adoption. At the same time, an introduction to them was added next to the photo of the cat.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/s3.jpg" alt="adopt"/>
      </figure>
      <h4 id="4">Activity page</h4>
            <p>For the volunteer activities, my initial concept is that users can directly see the pictures and introduction of the activities when they open the webpage. But I think it is not easy for users to find the activities they want to participate in, so in the second concept, I added a navigation bar about activity classification, and at the same time, the webpage will add search options.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/s4.jpg" alt="act"/>
      </figure>
      <h4 id="5">Shop page</h4>
            <p>For the store part, my first concept is to directly display product photos, names and prices. But I think this can't stimulate users' desire to buy. So in my second concept, I plan to show the photo of the production process on the top, and at the same time, show its story next to the product.</p>
                  			<figure>
				<img src="Ideation/s5.jpg" alt="shop"/>
      </figure>
      <h4 id="6">Donate page</h4>
            <p>For the donation part, my first concept is that users can directly fill in the information after opening the page to pay, but I think this is too straightforward. So in my second concept, I plan to show some motivational words at the top, and at the same time, distinguish the donation methods. I added bank information to increase the possibility of anonymous donations.</p>
